# Round-2-Eco ðŸŒ±
The Round-2-Eco is a simple desktop application which helps people to track/monitor their eco-friendly actions 
such as recycling, saving electricity or even riding a bike. Each of these eco-friendly activities has a 
score/rating and it lets the users know how much impact they are contributing as an individual or maybe 
as a group. It uses Python as its coding language and other tools to keep it simple and easy to use.

This is a **Sprint 1 prototype** featuring:
- Basic interface using **Flet**
- Local database setup with **SQLite**
- Sample backend with **FastAPI**
- Runs in your **browser** (via Flet browser mode)

## ðŸ”§ How to Run

1. Open a terminal
2. Install Flet:
3. Run the app by python main.py
4. Run python db.py to initialize local database
